# Web-Design
I've recently created a website using Figma as part of my ongoing effort to enhance my UI/UX design skills. 
This project allowed me to bring my own idea to a tech level with creativity and functionality. 
From this project, I've gained some valuable insights into the design process and tried to sharpened my ability to create user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces.
